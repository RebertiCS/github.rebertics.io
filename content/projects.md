## [KYFM](https://gitlab.com/KisuYami/kyfm)

> The fastest file manager.

Written in __C18__ and __ncurses__, with only 456 LOC, i made it to be fast and reliable.

## [RShell](https://gitlab.com/KisuYami/rshell)

> A shell with my name.

Written from scratch and rewritten many times, rshell was only intended for learning and not for real world usage.
It was indeed a fun project and to this day i still play around with it's source code.

## [KissVM](https://gitlab.com/KisuYami/kissvm)

> A byte code interpreter that is run in a __x86__ virtualized CPU.

It still a WIP, but it's a long time since i don't work in this project, some day i will find the energy to finish it.
