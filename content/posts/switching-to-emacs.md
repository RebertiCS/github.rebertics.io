## First Thoughts.
For a long time switched from editor to editor, from envroment to envroment, but i aways found myself
tweakin my tools, i craved for fancy things the were only acomplished by IDEs while saying that nobody
should use them.

## NeoVim, my first editor.
What makes vim great is the keybinds, it takes *willpower* and *time* to learn, but it's worth your time. In the
end you will have way more speed than before and will be able to do boring tasks in seconds without thinking
too much.

You can change almost anything of the editor, like it's looks and functionality, you can add auto-completion,
snippets and support for any programming language. But this ammount of personalization wans't enough for me.

## Emacs, The grandpa editor.
Emacs is quite old, it was made in a time where you wouldn't be able to use the same tools accross platforms
and they were many, from proccessors to OS, every time you wanted to use a new system you would have to
learn a entaire new envroment. Then emacs became a thing, now you didn't had to learn everything from scratch
you just had to port the core engine of the editor and you would have the same envroment accross platforms.

It has the same ammount of costumization of vim and even more, but you have to *read* and *research*. You can
use prebuilt configurations like **Spacemacs** and **Doom Emacs** so you can grasp the power of this tool,
but in the end you may feel the need to write you own configuration and that takes time.

## VSCode, The apple of the editors.
A good editor for somebody that can live without being able to change every single aspect of it. You will have mature
programming enviroment that can be expanded with extensions, and they can get really fancy, without too much research
you can have the best of the two worlds(editors and IDEs). 

I can't use VSCode because when i'm able to achieve the same enviroment I've in NeoVim and Emacs, the slowersness of it
make impossible to use this editor. It uses too much computer resources, resources that the editors that I'm used doesn't need.
